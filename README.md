# (Implementation) Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Rich Sutton & Andrew Barto
## Use the Repo Wisely
Most of the stuff here is just implementation of the algorithms in different chapters of the book. I did it to the best of my knowledge so there may be mistakes.

## Watchout for the random stuff
There is random stuff in there, like investigating some of the stuff, implementing random experiments and stuff. The notebooks have good markup headings so it shouldn't be hard to find a certain algorithm.
